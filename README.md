# Destiny 2 Unpacker
Put oodle dll in same directory. The oodle dll is from Destiny 2 directory.

Valid for all Destiny 2: Beyond Light packages from version 3.0.0.0 onward.

I recommend rewriting the unpacker in your own language to learn how it all works, as learning how this operates is crucial for for future D2 datamining.
